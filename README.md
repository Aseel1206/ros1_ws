# Code Documentation

##  Camera Capture Node

This ROS node captures frames from a GStreamer-based camera pipeline, saves them as images, logs precise timestamps, and publishes status and timestamp messages.

---

###  Features

- Start and stop image capture based on MAVROS mission waypoints.
- Save frames as `.jpg` images.
- Publish accurate absolute timestamps to a ROS topic.
- Log all frame metadata to a CSV file.
- Publish runtime status updates to a ROS topic.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

#### Python Packages

- `rospy`
- `cv2` (OpenCV)
- `numpy`
- `gi` (GObject Introspection)

#### ROS Packages

- `mavros`
- `mavros_msgs`
- `std_msgs`
- `sensor_msgs` (optional)
- `cv_bridge` (optional if image topics are used)

---

### Published Topics

- /camera/timestamps	
- /camera/status

### Subscribed Topics

- /mavros/mission/reached

### Params

```
<param name="start_waypoint" value="2"/>
<param name="stop_waypoint" value="5"/>
```
---

## Geotagger Node

This ROS 1 node synchronizes GPS, IMU, and camera image data to perform geotagging ‚Äî embedding geographic and orientation metadata into a CSV file for each camera frame.

### üõ∞Ô∏è Features

- Subscribes to:
  - `/camera/timestamps` (image timestamp and filename as `String`)
  - `/mavros/imu/data` (IMU data)
  - `/mavros/global_position/global` (GPS coordinates)
- Interpolates GPS and IMU data to match image timestamps
- Extracts orientation (yaw) from quaternion IMU data
- Saves geotagged data (timestamp, GPS, orientation, yaw, filename) to a CSV
- Publishes status updates to `/geotagger/status`

---

### üìÇ Output

Geotagged data will be saved to:
- /home/edhitha/geotag_output/geotag_data.csv

#### 
Each row of the CSV includes:
- [timestamp, latitude, longitude, altitude, orientation_w, yaw, filename]

  
---

### üß∞ Dependencies

Ensure the following packages are installed:

- ROS 1 (tested with Noetic)
- `rospy`
- `sensor_msgs`
- `std_msgs`
- `cv_bridge`
- `numpy`
- `opencv-python` (optional for future image handling)
- `mavros` (for GPS and IMU topics)

---

## Drone Status Monitor

`drone_status_monitor` is a ROS node designed to monitor the status of various components of a drone system, including MAVROS connection, GPS, IMU, camera, geotagger, and timestamps. It publishes a JSON-formatted summary to `/drone_status` and prints a detailed log to the terminal every second.

### Features

- Monitors ROS time and FCU (Flight Control Unit) time.
- Tracks:
  - MAVROS connection status
  - IMU data availability
  - GPS fix availability
  - Geotagger node and status
  - Camera node and operational status
- Publishes a JSON status string on the `/drone_status` topic.
- Prints detailed terminal output for debugging or live feedback.

### Dependencies

- ROS (Tested on ROS Noetic, but should work with other ROS 1 distributions)
- MAVROS
- Python packages:
  - `rospy`
  - `rosnode`
  - `std_msgs`
  - `sensor_msgs`
  - `mavros_msgs`

---

# Troubleshooting

## illegal Core Exception
- check if ```pyton``` returns python2 in terminal. If not set python to python2.

## Permission Denied when using usb connection for fc
```
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
```

## No gps and imu data from fc though usb
- In Mission planner, Set usb, baud rate, gps data frequency, etc
